Creating a website with some of my favorite recipes to make at home ! <br>
Getting html and css basics to stick while storing this precious information <br>

## Update 1
Instead of doing another repo for the landing page project, i just decided to revamp this one !<br>
I integrated the recipes in the card and tried my best to do a semi-responsive design. <br>
This means that the website still looks good if you reduce the size of the window<br>
but there are still clunky things in phone mode (like almost no margin xdd).<br>
The cards are great tho and they look good all the time !<br>
I didn't want to bruteforce the full responsiveness so i am waiting until i have some more knowledge.
