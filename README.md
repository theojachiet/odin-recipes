Creating a website with some of my favorite recipes to make at home ! <br>
Getting html and css basics to stick while storing this precious information <br>

## Update 1
Instead of doing another repo for the landing page project, i just decided to revamp this one !<br>
I integrated the recipes in the card and tried my best to do a semi-responsive design. 
This means that the website still looks good if you reduce the size of the window
but there are still clunky things in phone mode (like almost no margin xdd).
The cards are great tho and they look good all the time !
I didn't want to bruteforce the full responsiveness so i am waiting until i have some more knowledge.

## Update 2
Again, instead of doing another repo for the Login page project, i am adding a login page to this
magnificient recipe website ! I didn't do the exact design as i tried to fit mine in the viewport height.
I am quite happy with the result and the form interactivity even if i could go much further with animations
and everything... The responsiveness is super bad tho, i will need to come back to that another time. <br>
I also updated the index page mostly in terms of colors.
